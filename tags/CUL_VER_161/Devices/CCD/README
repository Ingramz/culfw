CCD is an extension for Raspberry Pi with a CSM radio interface and TFT display.

FLASHING FIRMWARE

	make 
	make program

on the RPi itself. This will require some tools installed upfront. 
Use:

	apt-get install make avrdude


to flash the recompiled hex-file.

* console in /etc/inittab
* debugging stuff - edit /boot/cmdline.txt

reboot when done!

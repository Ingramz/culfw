The RFbee is a small module containing an Atmel ATmega168 and a CC1101.
This directory contains the files necessary to build culfw for this
platform.

To flash culfw to the RFbee, at least RX, TX, DTR and GND need to be
connected to a (3.3V) serial interface. Then run "make program"
which uses the arduino-bootloader preprogrammed in the RFbee
to flash culfw. Make sure to set AVRDUDE_PORT to the right serial
port in the Makefile.

To use the RFbee from within Fhem, use something like the following
definition:

define RFbee CUL /dev/ttyUSB0@38400 1234
